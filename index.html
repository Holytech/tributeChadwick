            <p>
                Chadwick Aaron Boseman[7][8] was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina,
                the son of Carolyn (Mattress) and Leroy Boseman,
                both African-American. His mother was a nurse, and his father worked at a
                textile factory and managed an upholstery business. In his youth, Boseman
                practiced martial arts, and continued this training as an adult. As a child,
                he wanted to become an architect.[18] According to Boseman, DNA testing
                indicated that some of his ancestors were Krio people from Sierra Leone,
                Limba people from Sierra Leone, and Yoruba people from Nigeria.
            </p>
            <p>
                Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995 where he played on
                the basketball team. In his junior year, he wrote his first play,
                Crossroads, and staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and
                killed. He competed in Speech and Debate in the National Speech and
                Debate Association at T. L. Hanna. He placed eighth in Original Oratory at the
                1995 National Tournament. He was recruited to play basketball at college
                but chose the arts instead, attending college at Howard University in
                Washington, D.C. and graduating in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in
                directing. While at college he worked in a black bookstore near the
                university, which friend Vanessa German said was important and inspirational
                to him; he drew on his experience there for his play Hieroglyphic Graffiti.
            </p>
            <p>
                His teachers at Howard included Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad, who
                became a mentor. Rashad helped raise funds, notably from her friend
                and prominent actor Denzel Washington, so that Boseman and other
                classmates could attend the Oxford Summer Program of the British American
                Drama Academy at Balliol College, Oxford, in England to which they had been
                accepted. Boseman wanted to write and direct, and initially began
                studying acting to learn how to relate to actors. He attended the program
                in 1998, and developed an appreciation for the playwriting of William Shakespeare,
                studying the works of various dramatists including Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter.
                He also traveled to Africa for the first time while at college, working in Ghana with 
                his professor Mike Malone "to preserve and celebrate rituals with performances on a 
                proscenium stage"; he said it was "one of the most significant learning experiences of [his] life". After he
                returned to the U.S., he took additional course work in film studies, graduating
                from New York City's Digital Film Academy.

                    Boseman began dating singer Taylor Simone Ledward in 2015. The two
                    reportedly got engaged by October 2019, and they later married in secret, as
                    revealed by Boseman's family in a statement announcing his death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boseman was raised a Christian and was baptized. He was part of a church
                    choir and youth group and his former pastor said that he still kept his
                    faith. He studied Hebrew and had a good knowledge of both the Old
                    Testament and New Testament. Boseman had stated that he prayed to be
                    the Black Panther before he was cast as the character in the Marvel Cinematic
                    Universe.

                <p>
                    Outside of performing, Boseman supported various charities. He worked with
                    cancer charities including St. Jude's Hospital, continuing to support those
                    battling the disease up until his own death from it; in a message to a producer
                    days before he died, Boseman inquired about sending gifts to childhood
                    cancer patients. He donated $10,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of
                    Harlem to provide free tickets for children who wanted to see Black
                    Panther; he did this to support and promote the Black Panther Challenge
                    started by a New Yorker to raise money for similar children across the country.
                    In response, Disney donated $1 million to the Boys & Girls Clubs to advance its
                    STEM programs. Boseman advocated for children's charities, with the
                    Jackie Robinson Foundation noting after his death that he helped with their
                    youth outreach. When Disney planned to donate $400 million to charitable
                    causes, Boseman encouraged the move. In April 2020, he donated
                    $4.2 million in personal protective equipment to hospitals fighting the COVID19 pandemic in black communities, starting his own Operation 42 challenge to encourage others to donate PPE.

                    In politics, Boseman supported the When We All Vote campaign, and his last
                    tweet before his death was congratulating Kamala Harris on her selection as
                    Joe Biden's vice-presidential nominee.

                Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which eventually
                progressed to stage IV before 2020. He never spoke publicly about his
                cancer diagnosis, and according to The Hollywood Reporter, "Only a handful
                of non-family members knew that Boseman was sick... with varying degrees
                of knowledge about the severity of [his] condition." During treatment,
                involving multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, he continued to work and
                completed production for several films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, Ma
                Rainey, and others
            </p>
            <p>
                Boseman died at his Los Angeles home as a result of complications related to
                Illness and death colon cancer on August 28, 2020, with his wife and family by his
                side. He died without a will, and his estate will be governed by
                California law with the representation of Ledward. A public memorial
                service was held on September 4, 2020, in Anderson, South Carolina, where
                the speakers included Boseman's childhood pastor as well as Deanna BrownThomas, daughter of James Brown, whom Boseman portrayed in Get on Up. The city announced plans for the creation of a permanent art
                memorial at the service. Despite reports that Boseman was buried at
                Welfare Baptist Church cemetery in nearby Belton, South Carolina, the
                funeral home handling the services and the church pastor both denied this.

                <p>
                    Many fellow actors and other celebrities paid tribute to Boseman on social
                    media following the announcement of his death, including a number of his
                    Marvel Cinematic Universe co-stars. Marvel Studios president and CCO Kevin
                    Feige called Boseman's death "absolutely devastating", writing: "Each time he
                    stepped on set, he radiated charisma and joy, and each time he appeared on
                    screen, he created something truly indelible [...] Now he takes his place [as]
                    an icon for the ages." Co-stars from Boseman's other films also paid
                    tribute to him. His alma mater, Howard University, tweeted in reaction that
                    "his incredible talent will forever be immortalized through his characters and
                    through his own personal journey from student to superhero".

                <p>
                    On August 29, 2020, the day after Boseman died, the tweet in which his family
                    announced his death on his Twitter account became the most-liked tweet in
                    history, with over six million likes in under 24 hours, and accumulating
                    over seven million by August 31, far displacing the previous record holder.
                    His death was likened to other unexpected deaths of young black celebrities
                    in 2020, particularly Kobe Bryant and Naya Rivera. The Associated Press
                    and Clarín noted Rivera and Boseman as Hollywood's most impactful 2020 deaths.

                    Major League Baseball and the Los Angeles Dodgers, the franchise for which
                    Robinson played when the team was at its former home of Brooklyn, New
                    York, issued statements honoring Boseman, in light of his acclaimed portrayal
                    of the player. Several publications noted Boseman died on the
                    observance of Jackie Robinson Day, seven years after his having portrayed
                    Robinson. Prior to the fifth game between the Los Angeles Lakers and
                    the Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA playoffs, Boseman was honored with a
                    moment of silence, alongside Cliff Robinson and Lute Olson. When Lewis
                    Hamilton, the only black driver in Formula One, won the 2020 Belgian Grand
                    Prix, he dedicated the win to Boseman.
